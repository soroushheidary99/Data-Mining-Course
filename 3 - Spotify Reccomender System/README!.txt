- setModels file is used for training and fitting the models, 
you won't need to run that to get the results, the models are fitted
and then pickled to be used straightly in getModels file

- musicRecommender file, used getModels file to recommend you songs

- the files are not as modular as you'd expect though, sorry about that! :D
